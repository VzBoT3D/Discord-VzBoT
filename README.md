# Discord-VZBot

This bot (mainly) manages several functions on the VzBoT Discord server:

* Applying for and granting VzBoT serial ID's
* EzVz orders and providers
* Some support features

It's built around having custom rules for channels, to make management and permissions easier.

Plans for the future include implementing a custom warnings and punishments system, which is currently WIP. Time will tell whether this is still necessary.

The bot contains some functionality and features previously used on the TronXY Discord server, which are now no longer used. These will be removed in the future in order to streamline the VzBot Discord bot.
